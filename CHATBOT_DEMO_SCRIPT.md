1. **Google Gemini Integration**: Show how we connect to the Gemini API
   ```javascript
   // Using the latest model
   this.model = this.genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: 'gemini-1.5-flash-latest' });
   ```

2. **Environment Variable Loading**: Demonstrate our robust environment loading
   ```javascript
   // Proper environment loading with absolute paths
   const __dirname = path.dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url));
   const envPath = path.resolve(__dirname, '../.env');
   dotenv.config({ path: envPath });
   ```

3. **Intent Recognition**: Show how we detect user intents
   ```javascript
   // Example extracted from chat
   {
     "intent": "order_request",
     "extractedData": {
       "productName": "tomatoes",
       "quantity": 2,
       "unit": "kg"
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Confirmation Workflow**: Show the two-step process for safety
   ```javascript
   // Confirmation data structure
   additionalData.pendingConfirmation = {
     type: 'order',
     productId: bestMatch.id,
     productName: bestMatch.name,
     quantity: aiResponse.extractedData.quantity || 1,
     unit: aiResponse.extractedData.unit || 'kg',
     price: bestMatch.price,
     totalCost: bestMatch.price * (aiResponse.extractedData.quantity || 1)
   };
   ```

// Fallback system ensures responses even without API
try {
  // Attempt to get AI response
  const aiResponse = await this.generateGeminiResponse(message, context);
  return aiResponse;
} catch (error) {
  console.error('AI response generation error:', error);
  // Use fallback responses if AI fails
  return this.generateFallbackResponse(message, userRole);
