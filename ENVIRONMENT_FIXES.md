# StellarSoil Environment Variable Fixes

This document summarizes the environment variable loading fixes implemented across the StellarSoil platform to ensure consistent access to configuration in all services.

## Problem

The platform was experiencing issues with environment variables not being consistently loaded across different services, particularly in:

- AI chatbot service (aiChatService.js)
- Weather service (weatherService.js)
- Market price service (marketPriceService.js)
- Payment utility (payment.js)
- Chat controller (chatController.js)

## Solution

We implemented a standard pattern for loading environment variables using absolute paths across all services:

```javascript
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
import path from 'path';
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';

// Set up proper environment loading
const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);
const envPath = path.resolve(__dirname, '../.env');
dotenv.config({ path: envPath });
```

This approach ensures that:

1. Each service has access to the correct environment variables regardless of where it's imported from
2. The `.env` file is loaded from its absolute path rather than a relative path
3. Environment variables are properly loaded even in modular contexts

## Files Updated

The following files were updated with the new environment variable loading pattern:

1. `server/index.js` - Main server entry point
2. `server/services/aiChatService.js` - AI chatbot service
3. `server/controllers/chatController.js` - Chat request handling
4. `server/services/weatherService.js` - Weather data service
5. `server/services/marketPriceService.js` - Market price information service
6. `server/utils/payment.js` - Payment processing utility

## Additional Improvements

1. **Improved Logging**: Added log statements to confirm environment loading
   ```javascript
   console.log(`Environment loaded from: ${envPath}`);
   console.log(`API key available: ${!!process.env.SOME_API_KEY}`);
   ```

2. **Model Update**: Updated Google Gemini model from 'gemini-pro' to 'gemini-1.5-flash-latest'
   ```javascript
   this.model = this.genAI.getGenerativeModel({ 
     model: process.env.GOOGLE_GEMINI_MODEL || 'gemini-1.5-flash-latest' 
   });
   ```

3. **Testing Tools**: Created utilities for testing environment loading
   - `server/demo-chatbot.js` - Interactive terminal demo for testing the chatbot
   - Various test scripts for verifying environment variable access

## Verification

To verify that environment variables are loading correctly:

1. Check server startup logs for confirmation messages
2. Run the demo-chatbot.js script to test environment-dependent services
3. Monitor service logs for "API key available" messages
4. Test functionality that depends on environment variables (AI chatbot, weather service, etc.)

## Future Recommendations

1. **Keep Using Absolute Paths**: Continue using absolute path resolution for all new services
2. **Environment Validation**: Add validation for required environment variables at startup
3. **Configuration Service**: Consider implementing a centralized configuration service
4. **Environment Testing**: Add automated tests for environment variable loading
